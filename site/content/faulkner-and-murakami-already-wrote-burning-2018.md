Of course, Lee Chan-Dong is the screenwriter of the film Burning (2018) and in no way shape or form did he directly copy any of these authors. However, his film was loosely based on the short story by Japanese author Haruki Murakami Barn Burning and at the same time, Murakami’s short story was based on the story by the same name by North American author William Faulkner. In the South Korean film adaptation there are both direct and indirect references to each author and their version of “Barn Burning”.

American Literature, William Faulkner and Burning
-------------------------------------------------

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Photo of "Collected Stories of William Faulkner" in Burning (2018)](https://i.imgur.com/bC8ka3J.jpg)<figcaption>*Collected Stories of William Faulkner*</figcaption></figure>There are two key references that reveal the connection between North American literature and this film. The first one is the name of one of the characters: Ben. It is the abbreviation of Benjamin, a biblical name derived from Ancient Hebrew. The name by itself is foreign and the character fits with the stereotypical son of a rich Korean family that sent their son to study abroad. Whereas Ben is linked to the United States through education and culture, Jong-su uses literature to create his own link. During a conversation between the two, we learn that Jong-su identifies himself with William Faulkner which is the second key reference to North American literature. In addition, Jong-su has a degree in creative writing making him draw a parallel between Ben and Gatsby, the main character from another popular North American author called F. Scott Fitzgerald in his book “The Great Gatsby”. Much like Gatsby, Ben is mysterious, rich and his line of word is a secret. However, there is an enigma in a conversation between both character that I am yet to fully understand. When Ben asks Jong-su who is his favourite writer he answers William Faulkner and says the following:

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">> **“When I read his work, I feel like I am reading about myself”**
> 
> <cite>**Jong-su**</cite>

</figure>There is no way to know the meaning of this sentence without having read any of Faulkner’s books. Even after doing so, does this refer to Faulkner as a writer or is it about his personal life? Jong-su is an unpublished author writing a novel while Faulkner was quite prolific in life. Perhaps Ben did not completely understand the meaning of this sentence too because later on, we see Ben reading a book by Faulkner, the same book where Barn Burning by William Faulkner is. Such act showcases Ben attempting to understand Jong-su since understanding how Faulkner felt would also tell him how Jong-su feels.

Class, family and loneliness
----------------------------

There are many dichotomies in Burning: rich vs. poor, Korean vs. American/foreign, real vs. imaginary, etc. The differences related to class are evident by looking at the houses, their interior, exterior, location and decoration style. For example, Jong-su’s house is the typical rural house with a barn attached (wait, this Barn did not burn ha!) and is in an area with a lot of rice fields in Paju. Meanwhile, Ben lives in a luxurious apartment in Seoul with a very non-Korean look as evident by the American open kitchen, the abundance of wood, big bathroom and terrace.

The upbringing of characters can speak loads to how their personality developed and to learn about it in film, family plays a key role to give a general idea. Burning differs from other films because of the lack of close family members. Apart from Ben talking on the phone with his mother, the rest of the family members shown seem to have unresolved issues that makes their family dynamic complicated. The family dilemma between Jong-su and his father might be remembered as the boring part of the film because it has little dialogue and leaves it to the audience to figure out what is happening. However, it is vital to understand Jong-su and as said relationship mirrors the one in Faulkner’s “Barn Burning”. In brief, Abner Snopes is an arsonist who keeps burning down barns and has his young son Sarty help him. The short story opens with a scene during a trial about such behaviour where Sarty lies to protect his father.

The scenes at the courtroom where Jong-su goes to watch his father’s trial are the connection Lee Chan-Dong creates between his film and Faulkner’s short story. Both fathers are not the best role model but in spite of that, the family bond they have makes their children help them. For instance, Jong-su writes a letter of apology in place of his father and even has a neighbour corroborate it even when his father never asked for help and seemingly never wanted help either. His father was Jong-su’s only close family member and with him gone, Jong-su would be alone. However, maybe Jong-su was already alone before as he was not living with his father at the time his father was put in jail.

Loneliness is the best word to describe Hae-mi and Jong-su while we are unsure how Ben really feels but externally he seems to be doing well.

How did Barn Burning become Korean?
-----------------------------------

William Faulkner talks about family, race, ambition and the southern tradition in the United States in his work. Burning stands out for the differences in class and the lack of family support. Race and southern traditions are exchanged for the conflict between North and South Korea by locating part of the film in Paju, a rural area very close to the border, from where the characters hear North-Korean propaganda. Nevertheless, the plot takes much more from Murakami’s version which is set in Japan. The most relevant change is going from Barns to Greenhouses because it fits much better with the Korean rural scenery. Aside from that, the two hours and a half in Burning allow to explore much deeper the story than the original short story did. The result is a very long film that did not feel long at all. That makes me believe that this must be one of the best adaptations made from a story by Murakami.

Given you have made it to the end of the article, if you are interested in knowing more about Burning you can read more in this great article by Calvin McMillin called “[Watching the World Burn](https://www.brightwalldarkroom.com/2020/04/24/watching-the-world-burn/)“. Furthermore, if you have not watched or read The Great Gatsby, I recommend you watch the 2013 adaptation directed by Baz Luhrmann. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Gatsby and the no-longer Spiderman Tobey Maguire is in it too. Having watched The Great Gatsby makes crystal clear the similarities between Ben and Gatsby along with a feel about their shared personalities.
