These past few months, I have been thinking about how a narrator or the character we see a story through can influence the audience. Evidently, I thought: ‘**a good story must be true**‘. However, ironically, I could not be farther from the truth. Most stories are made-up or are combination of real experiences that are sometimes tweaked to attract the audience. The reason people watch the news is because knowing about what really happened makes it extra compelling. Therefore we could conclude that ‘a good story must seem true’. **A bunch of lies that look real are no different from real events**. To analyse this, I am going to take a look at all kinds of characters: from streamers to film protagonists.

Streaming Culture and Comedians
-------------------------------

![Sodapoppin apology video image](../uploads/2020/09/Untitled-edited.png)Streaming culture has taken over the internet within a short amount of time and platforms dedicated to it like Twitch have become mainstream and continue to grow exponentially. A live stream feels like having a window to what another person is doing, in a much more personal way than a scripted scene from a film or a tv show is. The **live interaction** **between the streamer and his or her audience** **is key**. In spite of that, I would never have anticipated that truth plays no role in how entertaining a streamer is. As some streamer said: “**You are only as good as your last three streams** because people quickly forget about what you have said or done”. With that in mind, it makes much more sense to answer the same question differently to make the audience think about what is real and what is not.

When the best comedians tell a story about themselves, there has to be a point of truth to it or make it seem like it. **The individual telling the story has to believe it is real himself for others to take it seriously**. For instance, take an apology video in which an influencer begs pardon to their audience for some evil deed. The expectation is a lot of ‘I am sorry’, an explanation of what happened and maybe crying. However, [this video](https://youtu.be/ODwMH0ooZVg) plays right into the expectations a viewer has and ends up giving the opposite effect an apology video has. Naturally, all the events told in the video look made-up but they are not. Aside from the ‘feeling sorry part’ everything he says is truthful. When a comedian or a film dabbles between crazy and normal it allows room for deeper thoughts that leave unanswered questions with the audience. Be fiction or real life, **great storytelling is what makes a story fascinating**.

Degrees of Truth: *The Boys* (2020) vs. *Burning* (2018)
--------------------------------------------------------

In in physiological thrillers, among other type of films, the story is told from the perspective of one the characters, an external narrator or a character who acts as a narrator. The story might have have exaggerated bits, fictional parts or be completely manufactured. **The protagonist might want to leave a good impression** of oneself and omit bad behaviour or might be too delusional to realise its own flaws. Depending on the situation, there are many reasons the narrator can alter the story.

Obvious examples of this can be a scene in a film where several subjects are questioned about the same event in a police station. Each suspect story is re-created slightly different and the detective has to piece the mystery together. One example is the 2003 film directed by Bong Joon-ho Memories of Murder. In murder mysteries some suspects present fiction as real and it is the job of the detective to believe it or not. The Netflix original The Boys presents the train of thought of Homelander first as if it was happening, however, what we would like to do and what we do does not always match.

The audience has to piece together the events of the film and complete the puzzle using hints provided by the director. I have written an article about Lee Chan-Dong and the relations between the source material and the film he crafts called [Faulkner and Murakami already wrote Burning (2018)](https://kumorihosoku.com/faulkner-and-murakami-already-wrote-burning-2018/). Hopefully my words work as an incentive for you to watch the film because a clip would of spoil important parts of it.

Disclaimer: Based on A True Story
---------------------------------

![The events, characters and firms depicted in this photoplay are fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or to actual firms, is purely coincidental.](../uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1-2.png)Interestingly enough, there are some disclaimers about how truthful a story might be. There are two types: **based on a true story** and **everything is fictional.** Each has a different reason for being there. Telling the audience upfront that the story is real inclines the viewer to believe the events. However, there is no way of knowing the degree of truth that is presented: it might be close to the truth or very far from it. In the other hand, the second disclaimer protects the filmmakers from possible liability while the first is an appeal to truthfulness.
